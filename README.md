# Task 2: Mining Sequential Patterns

## Overview
The objective of **Task 2** was to analyze the movement sequences of residents in four different cities (A, B, C, and D) to uncover common patterns of mobility using sequential pattern mining techniques. By preprocessing raw GPS data into structured triplegs and applying the **Generalized Sequential Pattern (GSP) algorithm**, we identified frequent movement patterns across each city.

## Data Preprocessing
To prepare the raw data for analysis, we implemented a systematic preprocessing workflow:

### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Missing Data Removal**: Filtered out invalid data points that which coordinates are marked as `-999`.
- **Timestamp Creation**: Standardized the timestamp format by combining date (`d`) and time (`t`) columns to form the `tracked_at` column.
- **Column Renaming**: Renamed key columns (`uid` to `user_id`, `x` and `y` to `longitude` and `latitude`) to match Trackintel’s required input format.

The cleaned data was then used to generate position fixes, which serve as the basis for identifying staypoints and triplegs. The full preprocessing flow is as follows:
**Raw Data → Preprocessed Data → Position Fixes → Staypoints → Triplegs**

### 2. Position Fixes Generation
We utilized trackintel's `read_positionfixes_csv` to read the preprocessed data to positionfixes, which are then used to generate staypoints and triplegs

### 3. Staypoints Generation
We generated staypoints using Trackintel's `generate_staypoints` function, fine-tuning parameters like gap and time thresholds to capture meaningful stops.

### 4. Triplegs Generation
With the staypoints identified, we used Trackintel's `generate_triplegs` function to extract triplegs, representing segments of continuous movement between distinct staypoints. 

## Data Analysis with GSP Algorithm
With the preprocessed triplegs data, we applied the **GSP algorithm** to discover frequent sequential patterns in residents' movements, providing insights into common mobility behaviors across the four cities.

## Results Summary
The GSP algorithm successfully identified frequent movement patterns across all four cities. Below is a summary of the results:

| City   | Frequent Sequences Generated | Average Sequence Length |
|--------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **A**  | 22,270                       | 2.21                    |
| **B**  | 14,099                       | 2.43                    |
| **C**  | 10,672                       | 2.42                    |
| **D**  | 6,591                        | 2.24                    |

By leveraging the Trackintel library for staypoint and tripleg generation and applying the GSP algorithm, we were able to uncover meaningful mobility patterns across different cities. These patterns provide valuable insights into residents' movement behaviors and serve as a foundation for predicting the next location in Task 3.


# Task 3 : POI Navigator

## Overview
**POI Navigator** is an intelligent location-based application designed to enhance users' exploration experiences by providing personalized suggestions for points of interest (POIs) within a city. Leveraging data mining and machine learning techniques, the app analyzes users' current locations and movement histories to offer relevant and accurate recommendations for places to visit.

### Key Features
- **City Selection**: Choose a city (A, B, C, or D) to explore.
- **Set Location**: Users can set their current location on the map.
- **View Location History**: Keep track of previously visited locations in the same city.
- **Next Location Suggestion**: Get personalized recommendations for the next POI to visit.
